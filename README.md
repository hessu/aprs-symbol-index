aprs.fi APRS symbols index
=============================

This is a machine-readable index of APRS symbol descriptions.  This is the
current list used by the aprs.fi web site.

For easy manual editing in OpenOffice, the master file is in CSV format.

Converted versions in XML, JSON and YAML are provided.


Background information
-------------------------

Bob Bruninga maintains an [APRS symbols index][symbolsx] on his web site. 
Most of the updates done on that list have not been deployed to APRS
applications, since it's hard to do that in a coordinated fashion, and it's
quite a lot of work to apply the updates.  The published list is not usable
in applications as-is, since the symbol descriptions contain a lot of
additional text which is not understandable to users unless the whole
document is viewed.  The updates do not have graphic design available.

This list is designed to be something that can actually be used in an
application, easily, without modification.

This list is compatible with the currently deployed APRS symbol graphics.
Symbol descriptions have been cleaned from additional text - only the symbol
itself is described.

This index will be gradually updated with some new symbols later, when the
symbol graphics themselves are updated.
